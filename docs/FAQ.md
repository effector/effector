## Why do we need to give names to events, effects etc. ?

This will help in the future, in the development of the effector devtools, and now it is used in the [playground](https://share.effector.dev) on the left sidebar.
If you don't want to do it, you can use the [babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effector/babel-plugin). It will automatically generate the name for events and effects from the variable name.
