Method for creating an [event](/en/api/effector/Event).

```ts
createEvent<T>(name?): Event<T>
createEvent(name?): Event<void>
```

**Arguments**

1. `name`? (_string_): Event name

**Returns**

[_Event_](/en/api/effector/Event): New event

### Notes

[Event](/en/api/effector/Event) â€“ it is a function which allows to change state when called (see [example 1](#example-1)) also it can be a good way to extract data (see [example 2](#example-2)). Also it allows us to send data to another event or effect via effector operators.

## Example 1

```js
import { createStore, createEvent } from "effector";

const incrementBy = createEvent();
const resetCounter = createEvent();
const $counter = createStore(0);

$counter.on(incrementBy, (counter, number) => counter + number).reset(resetCounter);

$counter.watch((counter) => {
  console.log("counter is now", counter);
});
// => counter is now 0

incrementBy(10);
// => counter is now 10

incrementBy(10);
// => counter is now 20

incrementBy(10);
// => counter is now 30

resetCounter();
// => counter is now 0
```

We created a store `$counter` and an event `incrementBy`, and started watching the store.<br/>
Notice the function call `incrementBy(10)`. Whenever you will call `incrementBy(10)`, you can look at the console and see how state of `$counter` changes.

## Example 2

```js
import { createEvent } from "effector";

const fullNameReceived = createEvent();

const firstNameReceived = fullNameReceived.map((fullName) => fullName.split(" ")[0]);
const lastNameReceived = fullNameReceived.map((fullName) => fullName.split(" ")[1]);
const firstNameUppercaseReceived = firstNameReceived.map((firstName) => firstName.toUpperCase());

firstNameReceived.watch((firstName) => console.log("First name", firstName));
lastNameReceived.watch((lastName) => console.log("Last name", lastName));
firstNameUppercaseReceived.watch((firstName) => console.log("Upper case", firstName));

fullNameReceived("John Doe");
// => First name John
// => Last name Doe
// => Upper case JOHN
```
