description: Separate module of Effector with plugin for Babel that improves DX over the library
---

Since Effector allows to automate many common tasks (like setting [Stable IDentifiers](/en/explanation/sids) and providing debug information for [Units](/en/explanation/glossary#unit)) there is a built-in plugin for Babel that improves DX over the library.

## Usage

Please refer to [Babel plugin](/en/api/effector/babel-plugin) docs for usage examples.
