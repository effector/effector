This method can be used for linking two nodes, resulting the third one, which will fire only upon `clock` node trigger.

Quite a common case, when you need to handle an event with some store's state. Instead of using `store.getState()`, which may cause race conditions and inconsistency of state, it is more suitable to use `sample` method.

## Formulae

```ts
sample({ source?, clock?, filter?, fn?, target?}): target
```

When `clock` is triggered, read the value from `source` and trigger `target` with it.

- If the `clock` is not passed, `sample` will be triggered on every `source` update.
- If the `filter` is not passed, continue as it is. If `filter` return `false` or contains `Store<false>` cancel execution otherwise continue
- If the `fn` is passed, pass value from `source` through before passing to `target`
- If the `target` is not passed, create it and return from `sample()`

## Schema

![](/images/sample-visualization.gif)

## Type of the created `target`

If `target` is not passed to `sample()` call, it will be created internally. The type of unit is described in the table below:

| clock\source                        | [_Store_](/en/api/effector/Store) | [_Event_](/en/api/effector/Event) | [_Effect_](/en/api/effector/Effect) |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [_Store_](/en/api/effector/Store)   | `Store`                           | `Event`                           | `Event`                             |
| [_Event_](/en/api/effector/Event)   | `Event`                           | `Event`                           | `Event`                             |
| [_Effect_](/en/api/effector/Effect) | `Event`                           | `Event`                           | `Event`                             |

How to read it:

1. You need to know the type of the `source`, it is a column
2. Type of the `clock` in the rows
3. Match the column and the row

For example:

```ts
import { sample } from "effector";

const $store = sample({ clock: $store, source: $store });
// Result will be store, because `source` and `clock` are stores.

const event = sample({ clock: event, source: $store });
// Because not all arguments are stores.
```

## `sample({clock?, source, filter?, fn?, target?, greedy?})`

**Arguments**

`params` (_Object_): Configuration object

- `clock?`: [Unit](/en/explanation/glossary#common-unit) or array of units
  - If event or effect: trigger `target` upon event or effect is called
  - If store: trigger `target` upon store is updated
  - If array of units: trigger `target` upon any given unit is called or updated. Shorthand for inline [merge](/en/api/effector/merge) call
  - If not passed: `source` is used as `clock`
- `source?`: [Unit](/en/explanation/glossary#common-unit) or object/array with stores
  - If event or effect: take last invocation argument value. That event or effect must be invoked at least once
  - If store: take current state of given store
  - If array or object with stores: take values from given stores combined to object or array. Shorthand for inline [combine](/en/api/effector/combine) call
  - If not passed: `clock` is used as `source`
- `target?`: [Unit](/en/explanation/glossary#common-unit) or array of units
  - If event or effect: call given event or effect upon `clock` is triggered
  - If store: update given store upon `clock` is triggered
  - If array of units: trigger every given unit upon `clock` is triggered
  - If not passed: new unit will be created under the hood and will be returned as a result of the `sample()` call. Type of created target is described [in table beyond](/en/api/effector/sample#type-of-the-created-target)
- `filter?` _(Function or [Store](/en/api/effector/Store))_ `((sourceData, clockData) => result): boolean | Store<boolean>`: If returns value of the function or store contains `true` continue execution otherwise cancel
- `fn?` _(Function)_ `((sourceData, clockData) => result)`: Combinator function, which will transform data from `source` and `clock` before passing it to `target`, [should be **pure**](/en/explanation/glossary#purity). If not passed, data from `source` will be passed to `target` as it is
- `greedy?` (boolean) Modifier defines whether sampler will wait for resolving calculation result, and will batch all updates, resulting only one trigger, or will be triggered upon every linked node invocation, e.g. if `greedy` is `true`, `sampler` will fire on trigger of every node, linked to `clock`, whereas `non-greedy sampler(greedy: false)` will fire only upon the last linked node trigger

:::warning{title="Deprecated"}
Since [effector 23.0.0](https://changelog.effector.dev/#effector-23-0-0) property `greedy` is deprecated.

Use `batch` instead of `greedy`.
:::

:::info{title="since"}
Array of units in `target` are supported since [effector 21.8.0](https://changelog.effector.dev/#effector-21-8-0)
:::

**Returns**

([_Event_](/en/api/effector/Event) | [_Store_](/en/api/effector/Store)) - Unit, which fires/updates upon `clock` is triggered, if `source` is not passed
[The type of returned unit depends on the types of `clock` and `source`](#type-of-the-created-target).

#### Example

```js
import { createStore, createEvent, createEffect, sample } from "effector";

const submitForm = createEvent();
const signInFx = createEffect((params) => {
  console.log(params);
});

const $userName = createStore("john");

sample({
  clock: submitForm /* 1 */,
  source: $userName /* 2 */,
  fn: (name, password) => ({ name, password }) /* 3 */,
  target: signInFx /* 4 */,
});

submitForm(12345678);
// 1. when submitForm is called with params (12345678)
// 2. take $userName store`s state ('john')
// 3. transform payload from event (1) and current store`s state (2)
// 4. trigger effect signInFx with params received at the step (3)
```

## `sample(sourceUnit, clockUnit, fn?)`

It is just another form of the `sample` invocation, with the same sense.

**Arguments**

- `sourceUnit`: Source [unit](/en/explanation/glossary#common-unit)
  - If event or effect. Take last invocation argument value. That event or effect must be invoked at least once
  - If store. Take current store's state
- `clockUnit`: Clock [unit](/en/explanation/glossary#common-unit). If not passed, `source` is used as `clock`
  - If event or effect. Trigger the sampled unit, upon event or effect is called
  - If store. Trigger the sampled unit, upon store is updated
- `fn?` (_(sourceData, clockData) => result_): Optional combinator function, [should be **pure**](/en/explanation/glossary#purity). Since, this handler is supposed to organize data flow, you should avoid declaring side effects here. It's more appropriate to place it in `watch` method for sampled node.

**Returns**

([_Event_](/en/api/effector/Event) | [_Store_](/en/api/effector/Store)) â€“ Unit, which fires/updates upon `clock` is triggered, if `source` is not passed.
[The type of returned unit depends on the types of `clock` and `source`](#type-of-the-created-target).

#### Example

```js
import { createStore, createEvent, createEffect, sample } from "effector";

const submitForm = createEvent();

const signInFx = createEffect((params) => {
  console.log(params);
});

const $userName = createStore("john");

const sampleUnit = sample(
  $userName /* 2 */,
  submitForm /* 1 */,
  (name, password) => ({ name, password }) /* 3 */,
);
/* 4 */
sample({
  clock: sampleUnit,
  target: signInFx,
});

submitForm(12345678);
// 1. when submitForm is called with params (12345678)
// 2. take $userName store`s state ('john')
// 3. transform payload from event (1) and current store`s state (2)
// 4. when sampleUnit (event in this case) is triggered,
//    send it payload to effect signInFx with params received at the step (3)

## `sample({name?})`

:::info{title="since"}
[effector 20.4.0](https://changelog.effector.dev/#effector-20-4-0)
:::

Every [unit](/en/explanation/glossary#unit) in effector may have a name.
You now can name sampled entities in the same manner as basic ones.

```js
import { createStore, sample } from "effector";

const $store = createStore(null);

const sampled = sample({
  source: $store,
  name: "sampled $store",
});

console.log(sampled.shortName); // 'sampled foo'
```

## Objects and arrays of _Store_ in `sample({ source })`

### Object of stores

:::info{title="since"}
[effector 20.8.0](https://changelog.effector.dev/#effector-20-8-0)
:::
`sample` can be called with an object of [_Store_](/en/api/effector/Store) as `source`:

```js
import { createStore, createEvent, sample } from "effector";

const trigger = createEvent();

const $a = createStore("A");
const $b = createStore(1);

// Target has type `Event<{ a: string, b: number }>`
const target = sample({
  clock: trigger,
  source: { a: $a, b: $b },
});

target.watch((obj) => {
  console.log("sampled object", obj);
});

trigger();
// => sampled object {a: 'A', b: 1}
```

### Array of stores

:::info{title="since"}
[effector 20.8.0](https://changelog.effector.dev/#effector-20-8-0)
:::
`sample` can be called with an array of [_Store_](/en/api/effector/Store) as `source`:

> Note: Typescript requires adding `as const` after the array is entered.

```ts
import { createStore, createEvent, sample } from "effector";

const trigger = createEvent();

const $a = createStore("A");
const $b = createStore(1);

// Target has type `Event<[string, number]>`
const target = sample({
  clock: trigger,
  source: [$a, $b] as const,
});

target.watch((obj) => {
  console.log("sampled array", obj);
});

// You can easily destructure arguments to set explicit names
target.watch(([a, b]) => {
  console.log("explicit names", a, b);
});

trigger();
// => sampled array ["A", 1]
// => explicit names "A" 1
```

### Support an array in `clock`

:::info{title="since"}
[effector 21.2.0](https://changelog.effector.dev/#effector-21-2-0)
:::

`clock` field in `sample` supports passing arrays of units, acting similarly to a `merge` call.

```js
import {createStore, createEvent, createEffect, sample, merge} from 'effector'

const showNotification = createEvent<string>()
const trigger = createEvent()
const fx = createEffect()
const $store = createStore('')

// array of units in `clock`
sample({
  clock: [trigger, fx.doneData],
  source: $store,
  target: showNotification,
})

// merged unit in `clock`
sample({
  clock: merge([trigger, fx.doneData]),
  source: $store,
  target: showNotification,
})
```

## Example with `filter`

:::info{title="since"}
[effector 22.2.0](https://changelog.effector.dev/#effector-22-2-0)
:::

The new variant of the `sample` works the same but with one extra method `filter`. Whenever `filter` returns `true` continue execution otherwise cancel. Let's see an example below.

Henry wants to send money to William. Henry â€“ sender and William â€“ recipient. To send money, sender should know the recipient address, besides sender has to sign the transaction. This example shows how exactly the `sample` works with a `filter`. The main points are:

1. Make sure balance is positive and more than sending amount
2. Having recipient address
3. Signed transaction
4. Make sure sender balance has been changed

```js
import { createStore, createEvent, createEffect, sample } from "effector";

const sign = createEvent();
const sentMoney = createEvent();
const $recipientAddress = createStore("a23x3xd");
const $balance = createStore(20000);
const $isSigned = createStore(false);
const transactionFx = createEffect(
  ({ amountToSend, recipientAddress }) =>
    new Promise((res) =>
      setTimeout(res, 3000, {
        amount: amountToSend,
        recipientAddress,
      }),
    ),
);

$isSigned.on(sign, () => true).reset(transactionFx);
$balance.on(transactionFx.doneData, (balance, { amount }) => balance - amount);

sample({
  source: {
    recipientAddress: $recipientAddress,
    isSigned: $isSigned,
    balance: $balance,
  },
  clock: sentMoney,
  filter: ({ isSigned, balance }, amountToSend) => isSigned && balance > amountToSend,
  fn({ recipientAddress }, amountToSend) {
    return { recipientAddress, amountToSend };
  },
  target: transactionFx,
});

$balance.watch((balance) => console.log("balance: ", balance));
$isSigned.watch((isSigned) => console.log("is signed: ", isSigned));

sign();
sentMoney(1000);
```
