It's difficult to overestimate the learning curve for any technology.
That's why effector provides you a few simple examples that may cover your basic needs and also give more confidence for the users for upcoming projects using effector.

## Simple examples

### [UI loading](https://share.effector.dev/FnfBfWhN)

To display loader during effects resolving

### [Effects sequence](https://share.effector.dev/vPbIFo0b)

We'll need it when second request to the server requires resolved data from the first one

<!-- TODO write example with abort with farfetched

### [Abort effect](https://share.effector.dev/W4I0ghLt)

When we need to cancel our effect since it's pointless at the time

-->

### [Modal dialog](https://share.effector.dev/8xsWOCeS)

To connect react modal with state

### [Range input](https://share.effector.dev/3EiBaDqd)

To connect a custom range input component with state
