This method allows you to get state from each passed store and **combine** it to a single value and save into a single store, that updates every time like each passed store.

:::warning{title="Caution"}
`combine` returns not just a common store. Instead, it returns [DerivedStore](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly), it cannot be modified by the events or used as `target` in [sample](/en/api/effector/sample).
:::

## `combine(...stores, fn)`

#### Formulae

```ts
$result = combine(
  $first, $second, $third, ...,
  (first, second, third, ...) => result
)
```

- After call `combine`, state of each store is extracted and passed to function arguments, `result` of a function call will be state of store `$result`
- Any number of stores can be passed to `combine`, but the latest argument always should be function-reducer that returns new state
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

**Returns**

[_DerivedStore_](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly): New derived store

#### Example

import demo_combineStoresFn from "./demo/_combine-stores-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineStoresFn} />

## `combine({ A, B, C }, fn?)`

:::info
Formerly known as `createStoreObject`
:::

#### Formulae

```ts
$result = combine({ a: $first, b: $second, c: $third });
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to properties `a`, `b`, `c` accordingly, that object will be saved to `$result` store
- Store `$result` contain object `{a, b, c}` and will be updated on each update of passed stores
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single update of `$result` store

#### Formulae with `fn`

```ts
$result = combine({ a: $first, b: $second, c: $third }, ({ a, b, c }) => result);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to properties `a`, `b`, `c` accordingly, calls function with that object
- The `result` of the function call saved in `$result` store
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

**Returns**

[_DerivedStore_](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly): New derived store

#### Example

import demo_combineObjectFn from "./demo/_combine-object-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineObjectFn} />

## `combine([A, B, C], fn?)`

#### Formulae

```ts
$result = combine([$first, $second, $third], ([A, B, C]) => result);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to array with the same order as passed stores, call function with that array
- The `result` of the function call saved in `$result` store
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

#### Formulae without `fn`

```ts
$result = combine([$first, $second, $third]);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to array with the same order as passed stores, that array will be saved to `$result` store
- Store `$result` will be updated on each update of passed stores
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single update of `$result` store

**Returns**

[_DerivedStore_](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly): New derived store

#### Example

import demo_combineArrayFn from "./demo/_combine-array-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineArrayFn} />

## `combine` with primitives and objects

It works the same as before. Now primitives and objects can be used in `combine`, and `combine` will not be triggered. Effector will not track mutations of objects and primitives.

#### Example

import demo_combineNonStoresFn from "./demo/_combine-non-stores-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineNonStoresFn} />

## Optional configuration \{#combine-optional-configuration}

All overloads of `combine` with `fn` provided are also supporting optional configuration object, wich includes:

- `skipVoid`: (_boolean_): Flag to control, how specifically store should handle `undefined` value _(since `effector 23.0.0`)_. If set to `false` - store will use `undefined` as a value. If set to `true` (deprecated), store will read `undefined` as a "skip update" command and will do nothing.

#### Example

```js
const $withFn = combine($a, $b, (a, b) => a || b, { skipVoid: false });
```
