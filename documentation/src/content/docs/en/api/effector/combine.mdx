This method allows retrieving the state from each passed store and combining them into a single value, storing it in a new derived store.
The resulting store will update every time any of the passed stores is updated.

If several stores update simultaneously, the method will process them all at once, meaning that `combine` batches updates, which leads to more efficient operation without unnecessary computations.

:::warning{title="Caution"}
`combine` returns not just a common store. Instead, it returns [DerivedStore](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly), it cannot be modified by the events or used as `target` in [sample](/en/api/effector/sample).

# Common formulae (#common-formulae)

```ts
declare const $a: Store<A>;
declare const $b: Store<B>;

// State transformation

const $c: Store<C> = combine({ a: $a, b: $b }, (values: { a: A; b: B }) => C);

const $c: Store<C> = combine([$a, $b], (values: [A, B]) => C);

const $c: Store<C> = combine($a, $b, (a: A, b: B) => C);

// State combination

const $c: Store<{ a: A; b: B }> = combine({ a: $a, b: $b });

const $c: Store<[A, B]> = combine([a: $a, b: $b]);
```

# State transformation (#state-transformation-methods)

When function is passed to `combine` it will act as state transformation funciton which will be called at every `combine` update.
Result will be saved in created store. This function [must be **pure**](/en/explanation/glossary#purity).

`combine` function called synchronously during combine call, if this function will throw an error, application will crash. This will be fixed in [24 release](https://github.com/effector/effector/issues/1163)

## `combine(...stores, fn)` (#methods-combine-stores-fn)

### Formulae (#methods-combine-stores-fn-formulae)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>
const $second: StoreWritable<B>
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>

$result: Store<D> = combine(
  $first, $second, $third, ...,
  (first: A, second: B, third: C, ...) => result
)
```

- After call `combine`, state of each store is extracted and passed to function arguments, `result` of a function call will be state of store `$result`
- Any number of stores can be passed to `combine`, but the latest argument always should be function-reducer that returns new state
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store
- Function [must be **pure**](/en/explanation/glossary#purity)

### Returns (#methods-combine-stores-fn-returns)

[_DerivedStore_](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly): New derived store

## `combine({ A, B, C }, fn)` (#methods-combine-object-fn)

### Formulae (#methods-combine-object-fn-formulae)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>;
const $second: StoreWritable<B>;
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>;

$result: Store<D> = combine(
  { a: $first, b: $second, c: $third },
  ({ a, b, c }: { a: A; b: B; c: C }): D => result,
);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to properties `a`, `b`, `c` accordingly, calls function with that object
- The `result` of the function call saved in `$result` store
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

### Formulae (#methods-combine-array-fn-formulae)

const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>;

$result: Store<D> = combine([$first, $second, $third], ([A, B, C]): D => result);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to array with the same order as passed stores, call function with that array
- The `result` of the function call saved in `$result` store
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

# State combination

When there is no function in `combine` it will act as state combinator, creating a store with array or object with fields from given stores

## `combine({ A, B, C })` (#methods-combine-object)

:::info
Formerly known as `createStoreObject`

### Formulae (#methods-combine-object-formulae)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>;
const $second: StoreWritable<B>;
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>;

$result: Store<{ a: A; b: B; c: C }> = combine({ a: $first, b: $second, c: $third });
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to properties `a`, `b`, `c` accordingly, that object will be saved to `$result` store
- Store `$result` contain object `{a, b, c}` and will be updated on each update of passed stores
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single update of `$result` store

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to array with the same order as passed stores, that array will be saved to `$result` store

# `combine` with primitives and objects (#methods-combine-primitives-objects)

Primitives and objects can be used in `combine`, and `combine` will not be triggered. Effector will not track mutations of objects and primitives.

### Examples (#methods-combine-primitives-objects-examples)

import demo_combineNonStoresFn from "../../../../demo/combine/non-stores-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineNonStoresFn} />

# Parameters (#parameters)

All overloads of `combine` with `fn` provided are also supporting optional configuration object as the last parameter.

## `.skipVoid` (#parameters-skipVoid)

Flag to control how specifically store should handle `undefined` value _(since `effector 23.0.0`)_. If set to `false` - store will use `undefined` as a value. If set to `true` (deprecated), store will read `undefined` as a "skip update" command and will do nothing

### Formulae (#parameters-skipVoid-formulae)

```ts
combine($a, $b, callback, { skipVoid: true });
```

- Type: `boolean`

### Examples (#parameters-skipVoid-examples)

```js
const $withFn = combine($a, $b, (a, b) => a || b, { skipVoid: false });
```
