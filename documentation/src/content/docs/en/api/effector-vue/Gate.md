_Gate_ is a hook for conditional rendering, based on current value (or values) in props. An example of a problem that Gate can solve – you can put together all required data, when component was mounted.

This allows you to send props back to _Store_ to create feedback loop.

Gate can be used via [useGate](/en/api/effector-vue/useGate) hook. Gate stores and events can be used in the application as regular units

Gate can have two states:

- **Open**, which means mounted
- **Closed**, which means unmounted

# Gate Properties (#properties)

## `.state` (#properties-state)

:::warning{title="Important"}
Do not modify `state` value! It is [derived store](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly) and should be in predictable state.
:::

`Store<Props>`: [DerivedStore](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly) with current state of the given gate. The state comes from the second argument of [useGate](/en/api/effector-vue/useGate) and from props when rendering gate as a component.

## `.open` (#properties-open)

:::info{title="Important"}
Do not manually call this event. It is an event that depends on a Gate state.
:::

[Event<Props>](/en/api/effector/Event): Event which will be called during gate mounting

## `.close` (#properties-close)

:::info{title="Important"}
Do not manually call this event. It is an event that depends on a Gate state.
:::

[Event<Props>](/en/api/effector/Event): Event which will be called during a gate unmounting.

## `.status` (#properties-status)

:::warning{title="Important"}
Do not modify `status` value! It is [derived store](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly) and should be in predictable state.
:::

`Store<boolean>`: Boolean [DerivedStore](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly), which show if given gate is mounted.
