# Best Practices in Effector (#best-practices)

This section contains recommendations for effective work with Effector, based on community experience and the development team.

## Keep Stores Small (#keep-stores-small)

Unlike Redux, in Effector it's recommended to make stores as atomic as possible. Let's explore why this is important and what advantages it provides.

Large stores with multiple fields create several problems:

- Unnecessary re-renders: When any field changes, all components subscribed to the store update
- Heavy computations: Each update requires copying the entire object
- Unnecessary calculations: if you have derived stores depending on a large store, they will be recalculated

Atomic stores allow:

- Updating only what actually changed
- Subscribing only to needed data
- More efficient work with reactive dependencies

```ts
// ‚ùå Big store - any change triggers update of everything
const $bigStore = createStore({
profile: {/* many fields */},
settings: {/* many fields */},
posts: [ /* many posts */ ]
})

// ‚úÖ Atomic stores - precise updates
const $userName = createStore('')
const $userEmail = createStore('')
const $posts = createStore<Post[]>([])
const $settings = createStore<Settings>({})

// Component subscribes only to needed data
const UserName = () => {
const name = useUnit($userName) // Updates only when name changes
return <h1>{name}</h1>
}
```

Rules for atomic stores:

- One store = one responsibility
- Store should be indivisible
- Stores can be combined using combine
- Store update should not affect other data

## Immer for Complex Objects (#immer)

If your store contains nested structures, you can use the beloved Immer for simplified updates:

```ts
import { createStore } from "effector";
import { produce } from "immer";

const $users = createStore<User[]>([]);

$users.on(userUpdated, (users, updatedUser) =>
  produce(users, (draft) => {
    const user = draft.find((u) => u.id === updatedUser.id);
    if (user) {
      user.profile.settings.theme = updatedUser.profile.settings.theme;
    }
  }),
);
```

## Explicit Application Start (#explicit-app-start)

We recommend using explicit application start through special events to initialize your application.

Why it matters:

1. Full control over application lifecycle
2. Simplified testing
3. Predictable application behavior
4. Ability to control initialization order

```ts
export const appStarted = createEvent();
```

call event and subscribe on it:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Without Scopes">

```ts
import { sample } from "effector";
import { scope } from "./app.js";

sample({
  clock: appStarted,
  target: initFx,
});

appStarted();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With Scopes">

```ts
import { sample, allSettled } from "effector";
import { scope } from "./app.js";

sample({
  clock: appStarted,
  target: initFx,
});

allSettled(appStarted, { scope });
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Use `scope` (#use-scope)

The effector team recommends always using [`Scope`](/en/advanced/work-with-scope), even if your application doesn't use SSR.
This is necessary so that in the future you can easily migrate to working with `Scope`.

## `useUnit` Hook (#use-unit)

Using the useUnit hook is the recommended way to work with units when using frameworks (üìòReact, üìóVue, and üìòSolid).
Why you should use `useUnit`:

- Correct work with stores
- Optimized updates
- Automatic work with `Scope` ‚Äì units know which scope they were called in

## Pure Functions (#pure-functions)

Use pure functions everywhere except effects for data processing, this ensures:

- Deterministic result
- No side effects
- Easier to test
- Easier to maintain

:::tip{title="This is work for effects"}
If your code can throw an error or can end in success/failure - that's an excellent place for effects.
:::

## Debugging (#debug)

We strongly recommend using the patronum library and the debug method.

```ts
import { createStore, createEvent, createEffect } from "effector";
import { debug } from "patronum/debug";

const event = createEvent();
const effect = createEffect().use((payload) => Promise.resolve("result" + payload));
const $store = createStore(0)
  .on(event, (state, value) => state + value)
  .on(effect.done, (state) => state * 10);

debug($store, event, effect);

event(5);
effect("demo");

// => [store] $store 1
// => [event] event 5
// => [store] $store 6
// => [effect] effect demo
// => [effect] effect.done {"params":"demo", "result": "resultdemo"}
// => [store] $store 60
```

However, nothing prevents you from using `.watch` or [`createWatch`](/en/api/effector/createWatch) for debugging.

## Factories (#factories)

Factory creation is a common pattern when working with effector, it makes it easier to use similar code. However, you may encounter a problem with [identical sids](/en/explanation/sids/#unique-sids) that can interfere with SSR.

To avoid this problem, we recommend using the [@withease/factories](https://withease.effector.dev/factories/) library.

If your environment does not allow adding additional dependencies, you can create your own factory following [these guidelines](/en/explanation/sids/#custom-factories).

## Working with Network (#work-with-network)

For convenient effector work with network requests, you can use farfetched.
Farfetched provides:

- Mutations and queries
- Ready API for caching and more
- Framework independence

## Effector Utils (#effector-utils)

The Effector ecosystem includes the [patronum](https://patronum.effector.dev/operators/) library, which provides ready solutions for working with units:

- State management (`condition`, `status`, etc.)
- Working with time (`debounce`, `interval`, etc.)
- Predicate functions (`not`, `or`, `once`, etc.)

## Simplifying Complex Logic with `createAction` (#create-action)

[`effector-action`](https://github.com/AlexeyDuybo/effector-action) is a library that allows you to write imperative code for complex conditional logic while maintaining effector's declarative nature.

Moreover, `effector-action` helps make your code more readable:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="‚ùå Complex sample">

```ts
import { sample } from "effector";

sample({
  clock: formSubmitted,
  source: {
    form: $form,
    settings: $settings,
    user: $user,
  },
  filter: ({ form }) => form.isValid,
  fn: ({ form, settings, user }) => ({
    data: form,
    theme: settings.theme,
  }),
  target: submitFormFx,
});

sample({
  clock: formSubmitted,
  source: $form,
  filter: (form) => !form.isValid,
  target: showErrorMessageFx,
});

sample({
  clock: submitFormFx.done,
  source: $settings,
  filter: (settings) => settings.sendNotifications,
  target: sendNotificationFx,
});
```

  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="‚úÖ With createAction">

```ts
import { createAction } from "effector-action";

const submitForm = createAction({
  source: {
    form: $form,
    settings: $settings,
    user: $user,
  },
  target: {
    submitFormFx,
    showErrorMessageFx,
    sendNotificationFx,
  },
  fn: (target, { form, settings, user }) => {
    if (!form.isValid) {
      target.showErrorMessageFx(form.errors);
      return;
    }

    target.submitFormFx({
      data: form,
      theme: settings.theme,
    });
  },
});

createAction(submitFormFx.done, {
  source: $settings,
  target: sendNotificationFx,
  fn: (sendNotification, settings) => {
    if (settings.sendNotifications) {
      sendNotification();
    }
  },
});

submitForm();
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Naming (#naming)

Use accepted naming conventions:

- For [stores](/en/api/effector/Store) ‚Äì prefix `$`
- For [effects](/en/api/effector/Effect) ‚Äì postfix `fx`, this will help you distinguish your effects from events
- For [events](/en/api/effector/Event) ‚Äì no rules, however, we suggest naming events that directly trigger store updates as if they've already happened.

```ts
const updateUserNameFx = createEffect(() => {});

const userNameUpdated = createEvent();

const $userName = createStore("JS");

$userName.on(userNameUpdated, (_, newName) => newName);

userNameUpdated("TS");
```

:::info{title="Naming Convention"}
The choice between prefix or postfix is mainly a matter of personal preference. This is necessary to improve the search experience in your IDE.

## Anti-patterns (#anti-patterns)

### Using watch for Logic (#watch-for-logic)

watch should only be used for debugging. For logic, use sample, guard, or effects.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="‚ùå Incorrect">

```ts
// logic in watch
$user.watch((user) => {
  localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
  api.trackUserUpdate(user);
  someEvent(user.id);
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="‚úÖ Correct">

```ts
// separate effects for side effects
const saveToStorageFx = createEffect((user: User) =>
  localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user)),
);

const trackUpdateFx = createEffect((user: User) => api.trackUserUpdate(user));

// connect through sample
sample({
  clock: $user,
  target: [saveToStorageFx, trackUpdateFx],
});

// for events also use sample
sample({
  clock: $user,
  fn: (user) => user.id,
  target: someEvent,
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Complex Nested samples (#complex-samples)

Avoid complex and nested chains of sample.

### Abstract Names in Callbacks (#naming-in-callbacks)

Use meaningful names instead of abstract `value`, `data`, `item`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="‚ùå Incorrect">

```ts
$users.on(userAdded, (state, payload) => [...state, payload]);

sample({
  clock: buttonClicked,
  source: $data,
  fn: (data) => data,
  target: someFx,
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="‚úÖ Correct">

```ts
$users.on(userAdded, (users, newUser) => [...users, newUser]);

sample({
  clock: buttonClicked,
  source: $userData,
  fn: (userData) => userData,
  target: updateUserFx,
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Imperative Calls in Effects (#imperative-calls)

Don't call events or effects imperatively inside other effects, instead use declarative style.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="‚ùå Incorrect">

```ts
const loginFx = createEffect(async (params) => {
  const user = await api.login(params);

  // imperative calls
  setUser(user);
  redirectFx("/dashboard");
  showNotification("Welcome!");

  return user;
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="‚úÖ Correct">

```ts
const loginFx = createEffect((params) => api.login(params));
// Connect through sample
sample({
  clock: loginFx.doneData,
  target: [
    $user, // update store
    redirectToDashboardFx,
    showWelcomeNotificationFx,
  ],
});
```

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using getState (#get-state)

Don't use `$store.getState` to get values. If you need to get data from some store, pass it there, for example in `source` in `sample`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="‚ùå Incorrect">

```ts
const submitFormFx = createEffect((formData) => {
  // get values through getState
  const user = $user.getState();
  const settings = $settings.getState();

  return api.submit({
    ...formData,
    userId: user.id,
    theme: settings.theme,
  });
});
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="‚úÖ Correct">

```ts
// get values through parameters
const submitFormFx = createEffect(({ form, userId, theme }) => {});

// get all necessary data through sample
sample({
  clock: formSubmitted,
  source: {
    form: $form,
    user: $user,
    settings: $settings,
  },
  fn: ({ form, user, settings }) => ({
    form,
    userId: user.id,
    theme: settings.theme,
  }),
  target: submitFormFx,
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Business Logic in UI (#business-logic-in-ui)

Don't put your logic in UI elements, this is the [main philosophy](/en/introduction/motivation) of effector and what effector tries to free you from, namely the dependency of logic on UI.

Brief summary of anti-patterns:

1. Don't use `watch` for logic, only for debugging
2. Avoid direct mutations in stores
3. Don't create complex nested `sample`, they're hard to read
4. Don't use large stores, use an atomic approach
5. Use meaningful parameter names, not abstract ones
6. Don't call events inside effects imperatively
7. Don't use `$store.getState` for work
8. Don't put logic in UI
