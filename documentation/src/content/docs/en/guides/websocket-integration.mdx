# Working with WebSocket in Effector (#websocket-integration)

In this guide, we'll look at how to properly organize work with WebSocket connection using Effector.

:::info{title="WebSocket and Data Types"}
WebSocket API supports data transmission in the form of strings or binary data (`Blob`/`ArrayBuffer`). In this guide, we'll focus on working with strings, as this is the most common case when exchanging data. When working with binary data is needed, you can adapt the examples to the required format.
:::

## Basic Model (#basic-model)

Let's create a simple but working WebSocket client model. First, let's define the basic events and states:

```ts
import { createStore, createEvent, createEffect, sample } from "effector";

// Events for working with socket
const disconnected = createEvent();
const messageSent = createEvent<string>();
const rawMessageReceived = createEvent<string>();

const $connection = createStore<WebSocket | null>(null)
  .on(connectWebSocketFx.doneData, (_, ws) => ws)
  .reset(disconnected);
```

Then create an effect for establishing connection:

```ts
const connectWebSocketFx = createEffect((url: string): Promise<WebSocket> => {
  const ws = new WebSocket(url);

  const scopeDisconnected = scopeBind(disconnected);
  const scopeRawMessageReceived = scopeBind(rawMessageReceived);

  return new Promise((res, rej) => {
    ws.onopen = () => {
      res(ws);
    };

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      scopeRawMessageReceived(event.data);
    };

    ws.onclose = () => {
      scopeDisconnected();
    };

    ws.onerror = (err) => {
      scopeDisconnected();
      rej(err);
    };
  });
});
```

Note that we used the [`scopeBind`](/en/api/effector/scopeBind) function here to bind units with the current execution scope, as we don't know when `scopeMessageReceived` will be called inside `socket.onmessage`. Otherwise, the event will end up in the global scope.

:::warning{title="Working in scope-less mode"}
If you're working in scope-less mode for some reason, you don't need to use `scopeBind`.<br/>
Keep in mind that [working with scope is the recommended way](/en/guides/best-practices#use-scope)!
:::

## Message Handling (#message-handling)

Let's create a store for the last received message:

```ts
const $lastMessage = createStore<string>("");

$lastMessage.on(rawMessageReceived, (_, newMessage) => newMessage);
```

And also implement an effect for sending messages:

```ts
const sendMessageFx = createEffect((params: { socket: WebSocket; message: string }) => {
  params.socket.send(params.message);
});

// Link message sending with current socket
sample({
  clock: messageSent,
  source: $connection,
  filter: Boolean, // Send only if connection exists
  fn: (socket, message) => ({
    socket,
    message,
  }),
  target: sendMessageFx,
});
```

:::tip{title="Connection States"}
WebSocket has several connection states (`CONNECTING`, `OPEN`, `CLOSING`, `CLOSED`). In the basic model, we simplify this to a simple Boolean check, but in a real application, more detailed state tracking might be needed.
:::

## Error Handling (#error-handling)

When working with WebSocket, it's important to properly handle different types of errors to ensure application reliability.

Let's extend our basic model by adding error handling:

```ts
const TIMEOUT = 5_000;

// Add events for errors
const socketError = createEvent<Error>();

const connectWebSocketFx = createEffect((url: string): Promise<WebSocket> => {
  const ws = new WebSocket(url);

  const scopeDisconnected = scopeBind(disconnected);
  const scopeRawMessageReceived = scopeBind(rawMessageReceived);
  const scopeSocketError = scopeBind(socketError);

  return new Promise((res, rej) => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      const error = new Error("Connection timeout");

      scopeSocketError(error);
      reject(error);
      socket.close();
    }, TIMEOUT);

    ws.onopen = () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      res(ws);
    };

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      scopeRawMessageReceived(event.data);
    };

    ws.onclose = () => {
      disconnected();
    };

    ws.onerror = (err) => {
      const error = new Error("WebSocket error");
      scopeDisconnected();
      scopeSocketError(error);
      rej(err);
    };
  });
});

// Store for error storage
const $error = createStore("")
  .on(socketError, (_, error) => error.message)
  .reset(connectWebSocketFx.done);
```

:::warning{title="Error Handling"}
Always handle WebSocket connection errors, as they can occur for many reasons: network issues, timeouts, invalid data, etc.
:::

## Typed Messages (#typed-socket-message)

When working with WebSocket, ensuring type safety is crucial. This prevents errors during development and enhances the reliability of your application when handling various message types.

For this purpose, we'll use the [Zod](https://zod.dev/) library, though you can use any validation library of your choice.

:::info{title="TypeScript and Type Checking"}
Even if you don't use Zod or another validation library, you can implement basic typing for WebSocket messages using standard TypeScript interfaces. However, remember that these only check types during compilation and won't protect you from unexpected data at runtime.
:::

Let's say we expect two types of messages: `balanceChanged` and `reportGenerated`, containing the following fields:

```ts
export const messagesSchema = z.discriminatedUnion("type", [
  z.object({
    type: z.literal("balanceChanged"),
    balance: z.number(),
  }),
  z.object({
    type: z.literal("reportGenerated"),
    reportId: z.string(),
    reportName: z.string(),
  }),
]);

// Get type from schema
type MessagesSchema = z.infer<typeof messagesSchema>;
```

Now add a message handling effect to ensure that messages match the expected types, along with the logic of receiving them:

```ts
const parsedMessageReceived = createEvent<MessagesSchema>();

const parseFx = createEffect((message: unknown): MessagesSchema => {
  return messagesSchema.parse(JSON.parse(typeof message === "string" ? message : "{}"));
});

// Parse the message when received
sample({
  clock: rawMessageReceived,
  target: parseFx,
});

// If parsing succeeds, forward the message
sample({
  clock: parseFx.doneData,
  target: parsedMessageReceived,
});
```

We should also handle cases where a message doesn't match the schema:

```ts
const validationError = createEvent<Error>();

// If parsing fails, handle the error
sample({
  clock: parseFx.failData,
  target: validationError,
});
```

That's it! Now all incoming messages will be validated against the schema before processing.

:::tip{title="Typing Outgoing Messages"}
You can apply the same approach to outgoing messages. This allows you to validate their structure before sending and avoid errors.
:::

If you want more granular control, you can create an event that triggers only for a specific message type:

```ts
type MessageType<T extends MessagesSchema["type"]> = Extract<MessagesSchema, { type: T }>;

export const messageReceivedByType = <T extends MessagesSchema["type"]>(type: T) => {
  return sample({
    clock: parsedMessageReceived,
    filter: (message): message is MessageType<T> => {
      return message.type === type;
    },
  });
};
```

Usage example:

```ts
sample({
  clock: messageReceivedByType("balanceChanged"),
  fn: (message) => {
    // TypeScript knows the structure of message
  },
  target: doWhateverYouWant,
});
```

:::info{title="Return Values from sample"}
If you're not sure what data `sample` returns, we recommend checking the [`sample` documentation](/en/essentials/unit-composition).

## Working with `Socket.IO` (#socket-io)

[Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) provides a higher-level API for working with WebSocket, adding many useful features "out of the box".

:::info{title="Socket.IO Advantages"}

- Automatic reconnection
- Support for rooms and namespaces
- Fallback to HTTP Long-polling if WebSocket is unavailable
- Built-in support for events and acknowledgments
- Automatic data serialization/deserialization

:::

```ts
import { io, Socket } from "socket.io-client";
import { createStore, createEvent, createEffect, sample } from "effector";

const API_URL = "wss://your.ws.server";

// Events
const connected = createEvent();
const disconnected = createEvent();
const socketError = createEvent<Error>();

// Types for events
type ChatMessage = {
  room: string;
  message: string;
  author: string;
};

const messageSent = createEvent<ChatMessage>();
const messageReceived = createEvent<ChatMessage>();
const socketConnected = createEvent();
const connectSocket = createEvent();

const connectFx = createEffect((): Promise<Socket> => {
  const socket = io(API_URL, {
    //... your configuration
  });

  // needed for correct work with scopes
  const scopeConnected = scopeBind(connected);
  const scopeDisconnected = scopeBind(disconnected);
  const scopeSocketError = scopeBind(socketError);
  const scopeMessageReceived = scopeBind(messageReceived);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    socket.on("connect", () => {
      scopeConnected();
      resolve(socket);
    });

    socket.on("disconnect", () => scopeDisconnected());
    socket.on("connect_error", (error) => scopeSocketError(error));
    socket.on("chat message", (msg: ChatMessage) => scopeMessageReceived(msg));
  });
});

const sendMessageFx = createEffect(
  ({
    socket,
    name,
    payload,
  }: SocketResponse<any> & {
    socket: Socket;
  }) => {
    socket.emit(name, payload);
  },
);

// States
const $socket = createStore<Socket | null>(null)
  .on(connectFx.doneData, (_, socket) => socket)
  .reset(disconnected);

// initialize connection
sample({
  clock: connectSocket,
  target: connectFx,
});

// trigger event after successful connection
sample({
  clock: connectSocketFx.doneData,
  target: socketConnected,
});
```
