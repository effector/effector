description: Separate module of Effector with plugin for Babel that improves DX over the library
---

Since Effector allows to automate many common tasks (like setting [Stable IDentifiers](/en/explanation/sids) and providing debug information for [Units](/en/explanation/glossary#unit)), there is a built-in plugin for Babel that enhances the developer experience when using the library.

# Usage (#methods-babel-plugin-usage)

Please refer to the [Babel plugin](/en/api/effector/babel-plugin) documentation for usage examples.
