This method allows you to get state from each passed store and **combine** it to a single value and save into a single store, that updates every time like each passed store.

:::warning{title="Caution"}
`combine` returns not just a common store. Instead, it returns [DerivedStore](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly), it cannot be modified by the events or used as `target` in [sample](/en/api/effector/sample).

# Methods (#methods)

## `combine(...stores, fn)` (#methods-combine-stores-fn)

### Formulae (#methods-combine-stores-fn-formulae)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>
const $second: StoreWritable<B>
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>

$result: Store<D> = combine(
  $first, $second, $third, ...,
  (first: A, second: B, third: C, ...) => result
)
```

- After call `combine`, state of each store is extracted and passed to function arguments, `result` of a function call will be state of store `$result`
- Any number of stores can be passed to `combine`, but the latest argument always should be function-reducer that returns new state
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

### Returns (#methods-combine-stores-fn-returns)

[_DerivedStore_](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly): New derived store

### Examples (#methods-combine-stores-fn-examples)

import demo_combineStoresFn from "./demo/_combine-stores-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineStoresFn} />

## `combine({ A, B, C }, fn?)` (#methods-combine-object-fn)

:::info
Formerly known as `createStoreObject`
:::

### Formulae (#methods-combine-object-fn-formulae)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>;
const $second: StoreWritable<B>;
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>;

$result: Store<{ a: A; b: B; c: C }> = combine({ a: $first, b: $second, c: $third });
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to properties `a`, `b`, `c` accordingly, that object will be saved to `$result` store
- Store `$result` contain object `{a, b, c}` and will be updated on each update of passed stores
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single update of `$result` store

### Formulae with `fn` (#methods-combine-object-fn-formulae-fn)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>;
const $second: StoreWritable<B>;
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>;

$result: Store<D> = combine(
  { a: $first, b: $second, c: $third },
  ({ a, b, c }: { a: A; b: B; c: C }): D => result,
);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to properties `a`, `b`, `c` accordingly, calls function with that object
- The `result` of the function call saved in `$result` store
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

### Returns (#methods-combine-object-fn-returns)

[_DerivedStore_](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly): New derived store

### Examples (#methods-combine-object-fn-examples)

import demo_combineObjectFn from "./demo/_combine-object-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineObjectFn} />

## `combine([A, B, C], fn?)` (#methods-combine-array-fn)

### Formulae (#methods-combine-array-fn-formulae)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>;
const $second: StoreWritable<B>;
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>;

$result: Store<D> = combine([$first, $second, $third], ([A, B, C]): D => result);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to array with the same order as passed stores, call function with that array
- The `result` of the function call saved in `$result` store
- If function returned the same `result` as previous, store `$result` will not be triggered
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single call of function and single update of `$result` store

### Formulae without `fn` (#methods-combine-array-fn-formulae-no-fn)

```ts
const $first: Store<A>;
const $second: StoreWritable<B>;
const $third: Store<C> | StoreWritable<C>;

$result: Store<[A, B, C]> = combine([$first, $second, $third]);
```

- Read state from stores `$first`, `$second`, `$third` and assign it to array with the same order as passed stores, that array will be saved to `$result` store
- Store `$result` will be updated on each update of passed stores
- If several stores updated at the same time (during one tick) there will be single update of `$result` store

### Returns (#methods-combine-array-fn-returns)

[_DerivedStore_](/en/api/effector/Store#readonly): New derived store

### Examples (#methods-combine-array-fn-examples)

import demo_combineArrayFn from "./demo/_combine-array-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineArrayFn} />

## `combine` with primitives and objects (#methods-combine-primitives-objects)

It works the same as before. Now primitives and objects can be used in `combine`, and `combine` will not be triggered. Effector will not track mutations of objects and primitives.

### Examples (#methods-combine-primitives-objects-examples)

import demo_combineNonStoresFn from "./demo/_combine-non-stores-fn.live.js?raw";

<LiveDemo client:only="preact" demoFile={demo_combineNonStoresFn} />

# Parameters (#parameters)

All overloads of `combine` with `fn` provided are also supporting optional configuration object as the last parameter.

## `.skipVoid` (#parameters-skipVoid)

Flag to control how specifically store should handle `undefined` value _(since `effector 23.0.0`)_. If set to `false` - store will use `undefined` as a value. If set to `true` (deprecated), store will read `undefined` as a "skip update" command and will do nothing

### Formulae (#parameters-skipVoid-formulae)

```ts
combine($a, $b, callback, { skipVoid: true });
```

- Type: `boolean`

### Examples (#parameters-skipVoid-examples)

```js
const $withFn = combine($a, $b, (a, b) => a || b, { skipVoid: false });
```
